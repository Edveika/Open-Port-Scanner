# Disclaimer

I **do not** condone using this script on sites that don't allow you to scan for ports.

# Open-Port-Scanner

This is a simple script that checks for open ports for selected IP address.

# Usage

``python App.py IP_ADDRESS``

Wait for a bit and it will print out a list of open ports for you.

# Adding more ports

This script only has 20 of most commonly used ports, if you wish to add more, modify the [Common Ports list](https://github.com/Edveika/Open-Port-Scanner/blob/bd0053f6294ac0bda9a9699a6055cc3c9c9bc7e1/Scanner/CommonPorts.py#L1)
